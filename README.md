# Todo
This was a small project of mine to demonstrate to myself that I am actually able to use react.

## Goal
Create a very simple front end web app that would be able to maintain several lists of todos. There should be the possibility to add, remove and change items. Lists should be able to be created and deleted.

## Shortcomings
All data is being stored in the redux state. This makes it possible to quickly integrate it with a backend, however for some elements it is quesionable if this is necessary.
